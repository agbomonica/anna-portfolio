# Anna Portfolio

A single-page portfolio website implemented with HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript.

## Site optimization

I leveraged on a couple of third party services for optimization to ensure good website performance and better user experience.

- [Squoosh image compression app](https://squoosh.app/)
- [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/): was used to reduce the size of SVG icons.
- [Open colour](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/): Open Color scheme generator (for tints & shades)
- [CSS gradient generator](https://cssgradient.io/)

## Deployed on netlify
